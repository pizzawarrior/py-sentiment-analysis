Running this project:
Use the -m flag to run modules, not file names. Eg:
    python -m models.logistic_regression_title
For some reason there is a ModuleNotFoundError when running file names, ie:
    python /models/logistic_regression_title.py

TODO:
- define WHAT we want this project to be. Is it an exploration? What does the result look like?
- We should have plots, but which ones? Is there a way to tease out only the most important ones???
-> Resample the data so that there are an even number of potitive and negative reviews to pull from
- refer to the fa24 nb where we oversampled, then joined the datasets and trained from there
